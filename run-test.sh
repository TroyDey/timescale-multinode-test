# Tests TimeScale's multi-node native replication feature in a simple failure scenario where one data node fails and is later restored
# The expectation is that when a data node is down transactions/commands that mutate data fail but SELECT will succeed as long as the data is available on other nodes
# The actual behavior is that even SELECTs will fail when the data node is down.
# AND once the data node is restored to service if it fails again SELECT's will succeed even when the data node is down.
# INSERTs do fail both prior to the data node being restored to service and after it is restored and subsequently fails
